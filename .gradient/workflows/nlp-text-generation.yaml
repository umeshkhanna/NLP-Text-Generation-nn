# YAML file for Paperspace Gradient NLP Text Generation Tutorial example
# It runs the GPT-2 model from HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/gpt2
#
# The Workflow is triggered when this is present in the .gradient/workflows/ directory in a GitHub
# repository linked to the user's Gradient project
# It clones this repo and then in turn calls the file nlp_text_generation.py
# This file outputs the generated text to outputs.txt in a Gradient-managed Dataset
# This Workflow runs on the Paperspace HuggingFace NLP container (paperspace/transformers-gpu:0.4.0)
#
# See the Gradient documentation page for more details:

# Appendix: Extra details
#
# pip3 install updates transformers from the version on the image to the latest
# This isn't required, but gives access to more models
# The script fails if "python" is used instead of "python3"
# Everything here is assumed to be running in the main branch of the repository
# The generateText job is OK on C5 (CPU) or P4000 (GPU) but may fail on smaller instances
# if they have insufficient memory
# The output dataset used is "demo-dataset", which is auto-generated in Gradient for each team
# This avoids requiring the creation of an output dataset before the YAML is run
# The output can be directed elsewhere, provided the alternative output Dataset location has been created
